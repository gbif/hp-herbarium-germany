Since 2015, the German Virtual Herbarium offers online access to specimens held in German herbaria that have been digitised to this day. Even though the [old data portal](https://search.biocase.de/vh) allowed to search specimens based on a wide range of criteria, the software was beginning to show its age in respects to both functionality and usability. For this reason, a new website has been established: Founded on software developed by and hosted on servers of the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org), it offers state-of-the-art views of the specimens as lists, map or in a gallery as well as filters on **all** data items (more on the features can be found in [this news item](/post/2020/features-explained/).

The German Virtual herbarium is a showcase for German herbaria. At its launch in May 2021, it allows access to almost [one million digitised specimens](/data?view=TABLE) held in [22 herbaria](/data?view=DATASETS). The data portal is based on GBIF’s index database, meaning that all GBIF-mediated specimens of German herbaria will also be accessible through the Virtual Herbarium. Almost 300,000 of the records come with at least one [digital image of the specimen](/data?view=GALLERY).

The underlying software is still in its development phase, with new features being added occasionally. Hence, we strongly encourage users to send feedback on the data portal, especially comments on usability and suggestions for potential additional features. But we’re happy to hear any opinion about the new website, just send us an [email](mailto:contact@gbif.de)!
